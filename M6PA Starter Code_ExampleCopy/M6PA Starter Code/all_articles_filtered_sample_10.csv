Google LLC has revealed Lumiere, an artificial intelligence system for generating videos that the company says can outperform earlier models in the category.

The Alphabet Inc. unit detailed the system in a research paper published on Tuesday. According to Google, Lumiere is capable of generating five-second videos with a resolution of 1024 pixels by 1024 pixels. It can create clips based on a text prompt or image provided by the user, as well as edit existing clips.

Under the hood, Lumiere comprises two separate AI models. The first, which Google's researchers have named Space-Time U-Net, generates an initial low-resolution clip based on the user's prompt. The second AI upgrades the resolution of that clip to produce the final 1024 pixel by 1024 pixel version Lumiere provides as output.

According to Google, the Space-Time U-Net model that creates the initial low-resolution video is based on a so-called diffusion architecture. This architecture underpins many of the most popular AI image generators on the market.

What sets diffusion models apart from other neural networks is the way they're trained. During training, a diffusion model is given a set of photos that contain a type of error known as Gaussian noise. It must then remove the error to recreate the original photos, a process through which it learns how to generate entirely new images from scratch.

Google's researchers based Space-Time U-Net on an existing, open-source diffusion model. They customized it by adding software components that can decrease and increase the quality of images. They also equipped the model with support for attention, a machine learning technique that allows neural networks to filter the information they consider when making decisions and disregard irrelevant data points.

Space-Time U-Net is not the only AI model capable of generating videos. However, it takes a different approach to the task than earlier neural networks in the category.

A video is a set of images, or frames, displayed one after one another. AI systems typically generate that sequence of frames in two phases. They create the first and last images in the subsequence, then add the remaining frames.

Space-Time U-Net goes about the task differently. Instead of generating a clip's frames piecemeal, it creates the entire clip in one pass. Google says that this approach allows Lumiere to generate higher-fidelity videos than many existing neural networks.

Google evaluated the AI system's capabilities by having it generate a series of five-second clips based on 113 different prompts. For added measure, the company also used a benchmark dataset called UCF101 in the assessment. Google's researchers determined that Lumiere achieved ""state-of-the-art video generation results"" compared with other neural networks designed for the same task.

Besides generating video content based on text prompts, Lumiere can also create clips in the style of a reference image uploaded by the user. It's likewise capable of modifying existing clips. Furthermore, Google says that Lumiere can create animations called cinemagraphs in which only some elements move while the others remain still.","uri: siliconangle.com, title: SiliconANGLE, importance: 312931",,"uri: U-Net, type: wiki, score: 5, label: U-Net; uri: Pixel, type: wiki, score: 5, label: Pixel; uri: Google, type: org, score: 5, label: Google; uri: Artificial_intelligence, type: wiki, score: 5, label: Artificial intelligence; uri: Diffusion, type: wiki, score: 4, label: Diffusion; uri: Artificial_neural_network, type: wiki, score: 4, label: Artificial neural network; uri: Alphabet_Inc., type: org, score: 3, label: Alphabet Inc.; uri: Diffusion_model, type: wiki, score: 2, label: Diffusion model; uri: Gaussian_noise, type: wiki, score: 2, label: Gaussian noise; uri: Filter_(signal_processing), type: wiki, score: 2, label: Filter (signal processing); uri: Open-source_software, type: wiki, score: 2, label: Open-source software; uri: Machine_learning, type: wiki, score: 2, label: Machine learning; uri: Software, type: wiki, score: 2, label: Software; uri: Benchmark_(computing), type: wiki, score: 1, label: Benchmark (computing)","uri: news/Technology, wgt: 83; uri: dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality, wgt: 100; uri: dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics, wgt: 100; uri: dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques/Imaging_Science, wgt: 100; uri: dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Robots, wgt: 100",eng-9246285,eng-9246285,15,0.2078431372549019,,

Chief Executive Satya Nadella sees a different future for cloud computing over the coming decade.

In his Microsoft Ignite keynote this past week, Nadella (pictured) laid out the five attributes that will define the cloud in the next 10 years. His vision is a cloud platform that is decentralized, ubiquitous, intelligent, sensing and trusted. It's one that actually titillates the senses and levels the playing field between consumers and creators by placing tools in the hands of more people around the world.

In this Breaking Analysis, we'll review the highlights of Nadella's Ignite keynote, share our thoughts on what it means for the future of cloud specifically and tech generally, provide a more tactical view of Microsoft and compare its performance within the Enterprise Technology Research data set.

Nadella made the statement that we have reached peak centralization today -- that we are witnessing radical changes in computing architecture from the materials used to semiconductors and software that will serve a new frontier forming at the edge. He envisions a world where there will be more sovereignty and decentralized control.

We couldn't agree more. The cloud universe is expanding and the lines are blurring between what's being done on-premises, across public clouds and the cloud experience will extend everywhere, with data flowing through a hyper de-centralized system.

To us, data sovereignty means that whatever the local laws are, the system will have the intelligence to govern privacy, data provenance and corporate edicts. Ambient intelligence is a field of research that leverages pervasive sensor networks and artificial intelligence to respond to and anticipate humans' needs and actions, as well as those of machines. Nadella sees a future where ""business logic will move from being code that is written to code that is learned from data."" He imagines a sort of autodidactic system as fundamental to tackling big problems like personalized medicine or climate change.

Nadella said there will increasingly be a balance between consumption and creation. Essentially he's predicting that creation will be democratized and his vision is to put tools in the hands of people to allow them to tip the scales toward knowledge workers, front line employees, students, everyone - creating content, applications, code and more. Power to the people! And underneath this vision are new forms of silicon, operating systems and entirely transformative digital experiences.

Picking up on the accelerated themes of remote work, Nadella emphasized that the future must accommodate flexibility in how, when and where people work. He sees a new model of productivity emerging, not necessarily defined by corporate revenue per employee (for example) but by the economic advantages that become accessible to everyone through better access to technology, collaboration tools, education and healthy lifestyles- all enabled by this ubiquitous cloud.

Nadella said ethical principles must govern the design, development and deployment of AI. The system must be secure by design with zero trust built in to protect business assets and personal privacy.

This was a big vision that connects the dots between bits and atoms, and sets up Microsoft to extend its reach well beyond office productivity tools and cloud infrastructure. He cited the Microsoft cloud as the underpinning of its future and specifically called out Teams, 365, HoloLens 2 and the announcement of Microsoft Mesh, a new mixed-reality platform.

Nadella said Mesh will do for virtual reality what Xbox live did for gaming - take the experience from single-person to multiperson. Holographic images with no screens empowering advances in medicine, science, technology and social interactions.

Although Nadella avoided naming the competition directly, one statement stood out to us:

We've come a long way from the days of discarding smartphones as soon as a new model comes out. Many shoppers are now demanding devices that will last for years, and they are being more conscientious about what happens to those gadgets when the need for an upgrade does arrive.

You may want to trade in your smartphone or sell it when the time comes; either option can keep your device out of a landfill in addition to scoring you some extra cash. There are also options to recycle part or all of your phone if it's too old to make a trade-in worthwhile. Whatever path you choose, there are important steps to take to prepare a phone you're about to get rid of. These instructions apply to any model you might have, including both iPhones and Android phones. Here's what you need to know.

Back up your data

Let's start with a very important reminder to do regular backups for all of your gear, not just your phone. It's a task you should keep up with routinely even when you aren't about to recycle or trade-in a device.

Most hardware manufacturers have an automatic cloud backup system, but you'll like your new phone a lot less if it doesn't have your full, up-to-date library of contacts, photos and other information. This is the time to manually back everything up with all of your latest data.

Also, before you get any further into the process, make sure that you know the critical details for your phone and the main accounts associated with it. Halfway through is the worst time to lose access to your device because you can't remember your username or password.

Unpair wireless accessories

Most people connect their phone to many other gadgets via Bluetooth. There are obvious ones, like smartwatches and wireless headphones, but you might also have your phone paired with something like a car stereo or a portable speaker. All of them should be unpaired from the phone you're about to trade in.

If you use your phone in two-factor authentication for sensitive accounts, you'll want to make sure that you disconnect the device from those services, too.

Log out of apps and services

Next, you'll sign out of the device's cloud-based service. For iPhone owners, that's iCloud, and on Android, it's the Google suite. This will avoid any confusion with your new device. You'll also want to turn off Find My on iPhones or Find My Device on Android phones. iPhone users should also deregister iMessage on their old iPhone, particularly if they're moving to a non-Apple smartphone. These steps might seem unnecessary when you'll end up wiping your device entirely, but you don't want to risk having your personal information accidentally made available to whoever might get your phone next.

Also, if you are under a plan that protects your phone, such as Apple Care or Preferred Care, you can usually cancel that coverage early. You'll get a refund on any unexpired coverage, and given how expensive gadgets can be now, it's worth getting that money back if you can.

Swap to the new device

At this point, your to-do list will vary. If you're planning to trade up to a newer model from the same manufacturer and you already have your new phone, then you'll want to transfer your data before moving on to wiping your old phone. Either in the store or on your own, in most cases you can wirelessly migrate your data from the old device to ","uri: engadget.com, title: engadget, importance: 162699",Anna Washenko: engadget,"uri: IPhone, type: wiki, score: 5, label: IPhone; uri: Smartphone, type: wiki, score: 5, label: Smartphone; uri: Gadget, type: wiki, score: 4, label: Gadget; uri: Android_(operating_system), type: wiki, score: 4, label: Android (operating system); uri: Backup, type: wiki, score: 3, label: Backup; uri: Wireless, type: wiki, score: 3, label: Wireless; uri: Cloud_computing, type: wiki, score: 3, label: Cloud computing; uri: ICloud, type: wiki, score: 2, label: ICloud; uri: IMessage, type: wiki, score: 2, label: IMessage; uri: Password, type: wiki, score: 2, label: Password; uri: Smartwatch, type: wiki, score: 2, label: Smartwatch; uri: Headphones, type: wiki, score: 2, label: Headphones; uri: Multi-factor_authentication, type: wiki, score: 2, label: Multi-factor authentication; uri: Google, type: org, score: 2, label: Google; uri: Bluetooth, type: wiki, score: 2, label: Bluetooth; uri: Stereophonic_sound, type: wiki, score: 2, label: Stereophonic sound; uri: Apple_Inc., type: org, score: 2, label: Apple Inc.; uri: Library_(computing), type: wiki, score: 2, label: Library (computing); uri: Factory_reset, type: wiki, score: 1, label: Factory reset; uri: App_Store_(iOS/iPadOS), type: wiki, score: 1, label: App Store (iOS/iPadOS); uri: Google_Play, type: wiki, score: 1, label: Google Play; uri: Nintendo_Switch, type: wiki, score: 1, label: Nintendo Switch","uri: news/Technology, wgt: 96; uri: dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics, wgt: 29; uri: dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications, wgt: 35; uri: dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing, wgt: 22; uri: dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data, wgt: 21; uri: dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Phreaking, wgt: 24",,,11,0.0509803921568627,,

Nvidia has resolved a trio of vulnerabilities impacting the GeForce Experience suite.

GeForce Experience is software designed by Nvidia with games and live streamers in mind, including driver update management, driver optimization for gaming and graphics cards, and both video & audio capture.

On October 22, Nvidia said the firm's latest security update tackles issues found in all versions of GeForce Experience prior to 3.20.5.70 on Windows machines. Nvidia says the issues could lead to ""denial of service, escalation of privileges, code execution, or information disclosure.""

The first vulnerability, CVE‑2020‑5977, has been issued a CVSS v3.1 score of 8.2 and is described as a flaw in the Helper NodeJS Web Server module of the software. An ""uncontrolled search path"" is used to load a module, and it is this lack of restriction that can be exploited by attackers for the purposes of executing arbitrary code, denial of service, privilege escalation, and information leaks.

The second security flaw, CVE‑2020‑5990, has been assigned a CVSS severity score of 7.3. Found in ShadowPlay, the live stream and broadcast facility in Nvidia's software, a vulnerability can be abused to trigger code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure. The vulnerability may also be utilized to perform a privilege escalation attack -- but this can only be performed locally.

Finally, Nvidia has resolved CVE‑2020‑5978, a low-impact vulnerability with a CVSS v.3.1 score of 3.2. A security flaw within GeForce Experience's nvcontainer.exe service, in which a folder is created under standard user login situations, can be abused for privilege escalation or denial of service attacks. However, the user account must already have local system privileges.

It is recommended that users accept automatic updates to receive the patch as quickly as possible. The vulnerabilities have been fixed in GeForce Experience version 3.20.5.70.

In July, Nvidia resolved a bug in the service host component of the software. Application resources were not verified properly, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code, compromise GeForce Experience itself, cause a denial of service, and leak data.

A critical privilege escalation vulnerability in Jetson, found within the Nvidia JetPack SDK, was also resolved at the same time.

Alibaba Cloud has created an English language version of Modelscope, its models-as-service offering.

Modelscope was launched in 2022 and is broadly comparable to services like Amazon Web Services' Bedrock or Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Studio. All are essentially libraries of foundation models from a variety of sources, offered in a form designed to ease the job of plumbing them into apps built on their respective cloudy hosts.

Alibaba Cloud claims it has won over five million developers as users of Modelscope since its 2022 debut, and that it is home to over 5,000 models. The Chinese web giant's own ""Qwen"" models are present, plus plenty from Chinese startups. The service also hosts what Alibaba Cloud describes as ""over 1,500 high-quality Chinese-language datasets and an extensive range of toolkits that support data processing.""

While the service has previously been accessible from anywhere - it's a cloud, after all - like its Western rivals Alibaba Cloud offers a text-heavy user experience. Your correspondent has plenty of experience applying online translation tools to Chinese text, and can report they regularly produce some odd artefacts that would not delight developers.

Modelscope in English therefore matters - not only in the US, where Alibaba Cloud launched the service at an event in Seattle, but across the Chinese cloud's target markets. In South East Asia, for instance, English is a more common second language - and lingua franca of commerce and tech - than Mandarin.

Alibaba Cloud is number three by cloud revenue share - behind AWS and Azure but sometimes beating out Google - in some of its target markets across Asia, but is not a major player elsewhere.

That's not for lack of ambition. It operates 89 availability zones in 30 regions, 16 of which are outside mainland China. The outfit also offers a comprehensive range of cloud services, a well-regarded cloud-native database named Apsara, has developed speedy CPUs to power its servers, and has shown off sophisticated cloud engineering such as clever edge boxes that use Intel ASICs to speed traffic, and tiering tech that doubled the number of VMs running on each of its cloudy hosts.

Alibaba Cloud is, however, not immune to concerns about China's national security laws, which compel it to share information with Beijing whenever asked. As clouds are often used for mission-critical workloads, many Western buyers believe Alibaba Cloud has a higher risk profile than its rivals. Adoption has therefore been modest outside of China and Asia, and Alibaba Cloud's datacenters in the West are said to host primarily Chinese clients.

The cloudy giant has, however, escaped bans - so far. Chinese telcos China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom - which also offer cloud services - have not been so lucky, as all had their activities in the US sharply restricted on national security grounds. Reuters reports that Washington may even be considering further action against the three over fears that their carriage services and clouds could compromise the safety of US data.

All of which will likely give pause to developers considering Modelscope's English language incarnation - no matter how intriguing the models and data it offers. ®","uri: theregister.com, title: TheRegister.com, importance: 277869",,"uri: Alibaba_Cloud, type: wiki, score: 5, label: Alibaba Cloud; uri: Microsoft_Azure, type: wiki, score: 5, label: Microsoft Azure; uri: OpenAI, type: org, score: 5, label: OpenAI; uri: Cloud_computing, type: wiki, score: 5, label: Cloud computing; uri: China, type: loc, score: 5, label: China; uri: Amazon_Web_Services, type: org, score: 4, label: Amazon Web Services; uri: English_language, type: wiki, score: 4, label: English language; uri: Microsoft, type: org, score: 3, label: Microsoft; uri: Startup_company, type: wiki, score: 3, label: Startup company; uri: Chinese_language, type: wiki, score: 3, label: Chinese language; uri: Lingua_franca, type: wiki, score: 2, label: Lingua franca; uri: Mandarin_Chinese, type: wiki, score: 2, label: Mandarin Chinese; uri: User_experience, type: wiki, score: 2, label: User experience; uri: Southeast_Asia, type: loc, score: 2, label: Southeast Asia; uri: Asia, type: loc, score: 2, label: Asia; uri: Google, type: org, score: 2, label: Google; uri: Seattle, type: loc, score: 2, label: Seattle; uri: China_Telecom, type: org, score: 1, label: China Telecom; uri: China_Unicom, type: org, score: 1, label: China Unicom; uri: China_Mobile, type: org, score: 1, label: China Mobile; uri: Alibaba_Group, type: org, score: 1, label: Alibaba Group; uri: Data_center, type: wiki, score: 1, label: Data center; uri: Telephone_company, type: wiki, score: 1, label: Telephone company; uri: Server_(computing), type: wiki, score: 1, label: Server (computing); uri: Mainland_China, type: loc, score: 1, label: Mainland China; uri: Engineering, type: wiki, score: 1, label: Engineering; uri: Intel, type: org, score: 1, label: Intel; uri: Central_processing_unit, type: wiki, score: 1, label: Central processing unit; uri: National_security, type: wiki, score: 1, label: National security; uri: Reuters, type: wiki, score: 1, label: Reuters; uri: Washington_(state), type: loc, score: 1, label: Washington (state); uri: Beijing, type: loc, score: 1, label: Beijing","uri: news/Technology, wgt: 99; uri: dmoz/Recreation/Models, wgt: 11; uri: dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale, wgt: 11; uri: dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Linguistics, wgt: 11; uri: dmoz/Business/Business_Services, wgt: 11; uri: dmoz/Computers/Software/Data_Administration, wgt: 11",eng-9683826,eng-9683826,13,0.2705882352941176,,

(File)

Facebook's conduct revealed in leaked documents is ""pretty concerning,"" said former Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt, who called for companies in the tech industry to show more restraint.

Facebook, now known as Meta Platforms Inc., ""went a little too far on the revenue side and not enough on the judgment side,"" Schmidt said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. ""You can see that from the Facebook leaks that have been occurring.""

The documents -- shared with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress by whistle-blower Frances Haugen and obtained by the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and other media outlets -- show that Meta struggled to contain hate speech and misinformation.

They also revealed that the company's own staff, including internal researchers, faulted it for failing to stop the proliferation of groups that fomented the US Capitol attack on Jan. 6. And internal studies spotlighted the potential risks of its Instagram photo-sharing app for teen girls. The company, valued at $934 billion, rebranded itself as Meta last month.

""The disturbing thing is that people have said a long time ago that Facebook was doing this, but people said, 'Well, they didn't understand or they didn't measure it,'"" Schmidt said. ""And what we learned in those disclosures is that these companies -- and Facebook in particular -- knew what it was doing.""

Still, Schmidt said he opposes trying to regulate the tech industry. ""The regulation is always either too soon or too late,"" said the executive, who was CEO and chairman of Google from 2001 to 2011 and executive chairman of the company until 2018. ""What I would rather have is sort of proper industrial restraint,"" he said.

The company's rebranding move to Meta speaks to a new emphasis on building a metaverse -- a virtual-reality social space that would eventually take over from the web and app social services of today. Meta said it will also seek to renew its appeal to younger users, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying executives will ""make serving young adults their North Star, rather than optimizing for the larger number of older people.""

Haugen, a former employee, testified last month before a panel of the Senate Commerce Committee. At the hearing, she criticized the company for not prioritizing the well-being of its users over profits. Zuckerberg has denied the characterizations, saying they're ""just not true.""

Schmidt, 66, is the co-author of a new book called ""The Age of AI"" -- along with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and computer scientist Dan Huttenlocher -- that examines how artificial intelligence is transforming human society for better and for worse.

Schmidt remains a technical adviser and top investor at Google's parent, Alphabet Inc., and he's chairman of the Broad Institute research center. While at Google, he orchestrated the acquisition of YouTube, another social service with billions of users that has drawn criticism for spreading misinformation.

The ribbon, known as the Magellanic Stream, was first discovered in the 1970s. Researchers believe the stream was ripped from two dwarf galaxies, imaginatively known as the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud billions of years ago. These two galaxies, filled with billions of stars, orbit the Milky Way, bound by its huge gravity to complete one full swing every billion years or so.

According to Joss Bland-Hawthorn, an astrophysicist at the University of Sydney, the stream consists of ""mostly cold and warm gas"" but very few stars. It's unusual, and how it came to be has puzzled researchers for decades. Andrew Fox, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute, calls the stream ""a 50-year puzzle."" Previous research has been able to account for the size and shape of the stream but not its mass -- the stream contains approximately 1 billion suns' worth of mass, but models can only account for a tenth of that.

So where did this cosmic ribbon come from and how did it get so massive?

New research, published in the journal Nature on Wednesday by an international team that includes Bland-Hawthorn and Fox, has helped answer these questions by using cutting-edge supercomputer simulations. The researchers showed there was a crucial element missing from previous modeling that could help account for the missing mass: the Magellanic clouds are themselves big enough to be surrounded by a hot ""halo"" of gas, just like the Milky Way.

""Our basic theories of galaxy formation predict such a hot halo around virtually every galaxy with a mass above a certain threshold, comparable to the mass of the LMC,"" said Thorsten Tepper García, an astrophysicist at the University of Sydney who was not affiliated with the study.

According to the research team, there are two stages to the stream's formation. Long before the Magellanic Clouds made their way into the Milky Way's cosmic neighborhood, they danced together, orbiting one another. The Large Magellanic Cloud's gravitational pull siphoned off gas from its smaller counterpart over billions of years, creating a halo of hot gas. Then the Clouds were captured by the Milky Way's gravity, and some of the halo was stretched and smeared across the Milky Way's outer edge.

These hot halos also explain another factor in how the Magellanic Stream came to be. In 2007, a publication by Bland-Hawthorn suggested the stream should ""fade from view"" when it hit the Milky Way's hot halo. But it didn't. The new work suggests the hot gas that surrounds the Magellanic Clouds ""protects"" the stream, pushing the galaxy's hot gas aside and preventing it from fading.

""This work redefines our understanding of how gas accretes onto the Milky Way and forms the reservoir for future star formation,"" said Bland-Hawthorn.

The new work is only a simulation, but it creates a testable hypothesis. The astronomers can now use space telescopes, like Hubble, to look for signs of the hot halo around the Magellanic Clouds. If they find it, the 50-year puzzle might be over. And if for some reason they can't get a good look? Well, it's only about 2.4 billion years until the Large Magellanic Cloud crashes into the Milky Way.","uri: cnet.com, title: CNET, importance: 141875",Jackson Ryan: cnet,"uri: Magellanic_Stream, type: wiki, score: 5, label: Magellanic Stream; uri: Milky_Way, type: wiki, score: 5, label: Milky Way; uri: Galaxy, type: org, score: 5, label: Galaxy; uri: Large_Magellanic_Cloud, type: wiki, score: 4, label: Large Magellanic Cloud; uri: University_of_Sydney, type: loc, score: 4, label: University of Sydney; uri: Galactic_halo, type: wiki, score: 4, label: Galactic halo; uri: Astrophysics, type: wiki, score: 4, label: Astrophysics; uri: Gravity, type: wiki, score: 4, label: Gravity; uri: Small_Magellanic_Cloud, type: wiki, score: 3, label: Small Magellanic Cloud; uri: Magellanic_Clouds, type: wiki, score: 3, label: Magellanic Clouds; uri: Dwarf_galaxy, type: wiki, score: 3, label: Dwarf galaxy; uri: Space_Telescope_Science_Institute, type: wiki, score: 3, label: Space Telescope Science Institute; uri: Astronomer, type: wiki, score: 3, label: Astronomer; uri: Nature_(journal), type: wiki, score: 3, label: Nature (journal); uri: Orbit, type: wiki, score: 3, label: Orbit; uri: Galaxy_formation_and_evolution, type: wiki, score: 2, label: Galaxy formation and evolution; uri: Amateur_astronomy, type: wiki, score: 2, label: Amateur astronomy; uri: Night_sky, type: wiki, score: 2, label: Night sky; uri: Constellation, type: org, score: 2, label: Constellation; uri: Accretion_(astrophysics), type: wiki, score: 1, label: Accretion (astrophysics); uri: Space_telescope, type: wiki, score: 1, label: Space telescope; uri: Simulation, type: wiki, score: 1, label: Simulation; uri: Star_formation, type: wiki, score: 1, label: Star formation","uri: news/Technology, wgt: 77; uri: dmoz/Computers/Internet/Broadcasting, wgt: 16; uri: dmoz/Science/Astronomy, wgt: 11; uri: dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars, wgt: 10; uri: dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Galaxies, wgt: 27; uri: dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images, wgt: 13",eng-6106644,eng-6106644,42,0.0588235294117647,,

Instead, the studio went public, vowing that it ""will not give in to the demands nor negotiate"" with the thieves, despite acknowledging ""that this may eventually lead to the release of the compromised data.""

Sure enough, that now appears to be happening. CyberNews, ""a research-based online publication"" that focuses on digital security, says the source code for CD Projekt's card game Gwent was posted to a hacking website on February 10 under the heading ""CDProject Leak #1."" Links to the leaked information on sites including Mega.nz and 4chan are now inactive, but the site was able to get a copy of the archive and said that the metadata indicates that it was taken on February 6, two days before CD Projekt Red ""became aware"" of the attack.

The title of the archive obviously suggests that there's more to come, and so does a readme file found inside, which warned that a second leak would occur the following day -- which is now today.

CD Projekt Red said that the hackers were also able to encrypt some devices on its network, although it was able to secure its IT infrastructure shortly after the attack and had begun restoring the locked data from backups. The CyberNews report says the author of the forum post linking to the leaked data has previously written about the open-source ransomware Cobalt Strike as well as other topics indicating that they have the skills and tools required to pull off a successful ransomware attack, and cybersecurity expert Luca Mella told the site that he believes the perpetrator is related to the ransomware group HelloKitty, echoing thoughts expressed shortly after the hack by Emisoft chief technology officer Fabian Wosar.

""This could mean the group is quite new and potentially growing fast after the compromise of such a high value victim,"" Mella said. ""Many other younger affiliate may join their operations after this. CD Projekt is really popular and widely discussed among underground and gaming communities.""

While known links to the leaked data have been disabled, Mella added that the archive has already been downloaded by many others, some of whom are now trying to extort their own payments. One ""threat actor"" who is not the author of the forum post disclosing the first leak said the source codes for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Thronebreaker, and Cyberpunk 2077 would be released today, February 11. Instead of a leak to online archives, however, this information will apparently be auctioned off -- anyone who wishes to get in on the action will, according to the post, have to make a deposit of 0.1 Bitcoin, which at the moment works out to about $4,800.

Except later might come too late, as I recently discovered after an unexpected (and much unwanted) reset of my router. Device configuration and settings all gone in a second...and with no recoverable backup on hand.

I don't have a right to complain, since I know better. (Originally the router setup was meant to be ""temporary"" at the start of the pandemic, but then, well...) Instead, let me serve as a lesson that you can easily improve on, especially since other things can go badly with your home network if you don't set it up right. Take an extra 15 minutes and follow the following four steps -- and don't put some of them off, like I did.

Looking to encrypt your data? If so, check out PCWorld's roundup of the best VPN services available right now.

Let's start with the step I skipped and ultimately regretted.

Few people use strictly default settings on their router (and honestly, for better security, you shouldn't leave them as they are out of the box). Most folks at least change things like the name of their Wi-Fi network and its password. You may also have a guest network and parental controls in place, and possibly more granular tweaks like quality of service (QoS) settings.

Backing up your settings periodically is ideal -- every time you make a new adjustment, it's a good idea to create a new backup. You should be able to find the backup option pretty easily within your router settings, but if not, your router's manual should explain how to do so. It will save you time if you ever have to reset your router (or, in my case, you effectively reset the router through sheer dumb behavior). After the reset, you can load the file with your saved configuration and be back to status quo (or dang close to it) within just a few minutes.

Even if you don't backup every time you make a change, do so after you first get your router up and running. You'll have a baseline to work with should disaster strike.

You'll often get urged by tech journalists like me to keep your firmware updated for security reasons -- and that is true. Vulnerabilities can allow bad actors to gain access to your router and then spy on your network traffic, use your router to attack other devices on the wider internet, or just simply disable it.

There's another other main reason to stay up to date, though. Firmware updates often include fixes for bugs that can affect your router's functionality. In my case, my accidental router wipe happened due to older firmware causing periodic issues with logging into the device. I thought a reboot could help the problem. I accidentally ended up resetting my router instead.

The easy way to deal with this? Turn on automatic firmware updates for your router. Depending on the model you own, this can be full automatic updating, or automatic downloads that still require manual installation. If human intervention is involved, make it part of your PC's regular maintenance schedule to check up on your router every so often, too.

(For what it's worth, my setup required full manual downloading and updating, so while I was lazy, I was not outright ignoring options that would have made my life much simpler.)

Your Wi-Fi network needs a password -- and a good method of securing the traffic going to and from the router.
